## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data to understand various aspects of the EV market, including adoption trends, geographical distribution, manufacturer performance, and the impact of incentives. The analysis is presented through an interactive dashboard built using Tableau, allowing for dynamic exploration of key metrics and insights.

The data used in this analysis helps to answer critical questions about the growth and characteristics of the electric vehicle landscape.

## Tableau Dashboard Overview

This interactive Tableau dashboard provides a visual representation of the data, allowing users to explore the key metrics and trends. It includes visualizations such as:

* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for overall EV numbers, BEV/PHEV breakdown, and average range.
* Trends in EV adoption over time.
* Geographical distribution of EVs across states.
* Ranking of top EV manufacturers and models.
* Proportion of vehicles eligible for CAFV incentives.

*(A visual representation of the dashboard is included as `dashboard_preview.png` in this repository.)*

## Problem Statement & Requirements

This project aims to address the following key areas through data analysis and visualization:

### Charts Requirement:

1.  **Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards):** Line/Area Chart illustrating growth patterns.
2.  **Total Vehicles by State:** Map Chart showcasing geographical distribution.
3.  **Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make:** Bar Chart highlighting leading manufacturers.
4.  **Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility:** Pie or Donut Chart illustrating incentive impact.
5.  **Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model:** Treemap highlighting popular models.

### KPI's Requirement:

1.  **Total Vehicles:** Overall market size and growth.
2.  **Average Electric Range:** Technological advancements in EV efficiency.
3.  **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:** Dominance of fully electric models.
4.  **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:** Market share of plug-in hybrid models.

## Key Insights

* **Overall Adoption Trend:** The "Total Vehicles by Model Year" chart shows a significant increase in EV adoption, especially after 2020, with a steep climb in 2023 and 2024. This indicates a rapid acceleration in the EV market.
* **State-Level Differences:** Washington (WA) has the highest number of EVs registered, with 150,082 vehicles. California also appears to have a high concentration based on the map. This suggests that the West Coast is a major hub for EV adoption.
* **Leading Manufacturers:** Tesla is the dominant market leader, accounting for 52.70% of all EVs (68,939 vehicles). Nissan and Chevrolet are the next leading manufacturers, with 10.32% and 9.19% market share, respectively.
* **CAFV Eligibility Impact:** A significant portion of vehicles (46.34%) have an "Unknown" CAFV eligibility status. Of the known eligibility, 41.81% are CAFV eligible, while 11.85% are not. The high "Unknown" percentage makes it difficult to fully assess the incentive impact.
* **Popular Models:** The Tesla Model Y is the most popular EV model, accounting for 18.95% of the total, followed closely by the Tesla Model 3 at 18.42%. This highlights the strong consumer preference for Tesla vehicles.
* **BEV vs. PHEV Trends:** Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate the market share at 77.6% (116,745 vehicles), significantly outnumbering Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), which account for 22.4% (33,668 vehicles). This suggests a growing preference for fully electric vehicles.
* **Average Electric Range:** The average electric range of the vehicles in the dataset is 67.83 miles. The "Total Vehicles by Model Year" chart doesn't show a clear trend of significant increase in average range over time in this dataset.

2.  Once on Tableau Public, you can interact with the various charts, maps, and controls:
    * Use any **filters** available on the dashboard to narrow down the data by specific criteria (e.g., year, state, make, model, CAFV eligibility).
    * **Hover** over data points (bars, lines, map regions, slices) to see detailed information and tooltips.
    * Pay attention to any **interactive actions** that might be implemented (e.g., clicking on a state to filter other charts).
    * Explore the different **sheets/tabs** within the Tableau Public workbook to see various perspectives on the data.

## Tools Used

* **Tableau Desktop:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
* **[Mention your Data Source(s) here - e.g., Publicly available EV registration data, Government datasets, etc.]**
